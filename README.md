#### Story:
　Basically, you can learn many skills and clear your questions online, but the downside is that the information you are looking for is scattered all over the Internet and it can be time consuming.

　So if I have never touched a field before and I know that I will need to do a lot of Googling to learn it, I will consider buying a technical book that has been systematically compiled by predecessors. This is because it is more efficient. However, there is always a big wall standing in the way.

　**Price**. The average price of technical books is so high that I can't afford to buy them. Every time I go to the technical book section of a bookstore, I think to myself, "I wish I had all these bookshelves”.

　In the midst of this, I realized that I rarely reread the technical books I bought in the past. This is because when you gain basic skills in a field through technical books, you develop an "intuition" to goole, and you don't need to reread them as much.

　So if other people are doing the same, then there must be people out there who have stopped reading the books I want! So I created this service.

　I would be happy if I could turn a technical book lying in the corner of your bookshelf into a technical book that you want, and a chance to meet new people.
